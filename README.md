## To run the frontend
1. open a terminal window in the frontend folder
2. type in "npm start"
3. the server will be available at localhost:3000/

## The backend
The backend cannot be run currently unless the enviroment is pushed to an aws enviroment and then setup from there. I plan on adding that ability to build this project from any computer in the future.
